# milestone3-NN-techniques
We want to apply the NN techniques to the data that we had prepared.

IMPORTANT NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO RUN Main.ipynb, YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE DATA FILE. SO, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT PROM PREVIOUS MILESTONE; clean_data.csv.

In this milestone, we are concerned with the efficiency of differend Neural Networks; fit_time, prediction_time, accuracy, etc. Although the structure of this MS is like the previous MS, but we have done a thorogh and comprehensive study on the performance of the models. Five models has been tested deeply; please note that if you have completely random NN, the accuracy should be around 4%. While our models can easily provide more than 50%.

Also, we have achieved some important results for our task:
1. Four or five layers should be enough for our task.
2. We need about 1000 nodes to creat a good model.
3. Regularization is beter than Dropout for this task.
4. It's better to increase the number of nodes at the primary layers, and then decrease them.

Main.ipynb is the code file for milestone3, but you can also look at Main_with_outputs.pdf instead.

Group members: Hamid Pour Mohammad, Mehdi Naghi Lou, and Saeid Entezari.
